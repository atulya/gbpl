          <p>Today healthcare domain is poignant with rich heritage of manufacturing facilities that are multi faceted with huge capacities in producing diverse range of product dosage forms but are largely under-utilized due to dearth of muscle power to cater the DNA  (Research) and Front end (market) of the organizational structural force. Therefore more than 70% of these assets are many-a-times with idle or huge spare capacities for consumption.</p>
          <p>
            Moreover as most of the assets are engaged in meeting production demands that are largely catering to only limited present needs of the medical society, these assets do not provide sustainable long term value in economics lacking the agility required to produce Innovative products that accommodate the growing demands of the global markets.      In order to enable the best of both worlds meet (Innovation and Markets) cost effectively, Gbennetti invests and develops strategic ‘ Global Capacity Pool Partners’ (GCPP) that establishes long term sustainable value chain model for bringing innovations to Life by
