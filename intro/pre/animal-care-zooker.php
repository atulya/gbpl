            <span>Human</span> Life is incomplete without Care. Care that is lasting and longing at its innermost core is always not manifested from our siblings alone, but many times from our fellow beings from nature such as companion animals like dogs/cats /fish or farm animals like horses, chickens, cattle who care for us in their own ways.  Companions offer unconditional love and care till their last breath unreservedly while Farm animals offer us health and nourishment compromising on their life –all for us.
