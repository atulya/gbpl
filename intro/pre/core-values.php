<p align="center"><em>“Be torch-bearers of Bennett in truly global sense”</em></p>
 GBennett is a Latin name, which means Being Blessed. At GBennetti, our dogma of global quality living and well being which transpires from its global product blessings draws its very inheritance in this name. Being blessed is to live a Life of omniscence that is beyond an ordinary physical state of being-it dives deep into the eternal state of well being that originates from the mind and the soul.
<br><br>
 We uphold those value streams that originate from ancient Karmic principles of Life preserving the Bliss from ‘Purity of the mind’ and the Benevolence from ‘ Sanctity of the Soul or Spirit’. We culminate them with global contemporary tenets of competitive corporate living stimulating the Brilliance of Performance from the facets of the Body. This results into a deep-rooted strong valued perpetuation of a GBennetti culture of ‘Cosmic lustrous living of brilliance endowed with karmic illustrious life of bliss and benevolence’ that every GBennetian symbolizes. 
<br><br>
 This culture is ingrained into working philosophy that is echoed in 14 lasting principles guiding the 7 service Pillars of GBennetti. These 7 service Pillars are inspired from Booms and Bitner model and constituted by Ambassadors (People), Levers of Performance (Product, Price, Place, Promotion, Process) &amp; Benefactors (Physical evidence) put together in synergy. At the center stage of the cultural inheritance are the core values of 3B’s (Bliss, Brilliance, Benevolence) that govern our corporate credentials as a whole.
