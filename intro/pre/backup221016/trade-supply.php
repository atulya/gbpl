            As per WHO estimates, NCDs(Non communicable diseases) are increasingly replacing infectious diseases as the leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

            As the global disease burden of NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer, stroke is on rise, institutional business represents rewarding opportunity. Asthma/COPD, CVD, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and Cancer are global alarming disease threats. According to WHO sources, these diseases together are responsible for 28 million deaths per year and form the greater portion of NCD burden. Yet they only receive 1% of the funding while infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis and malaria continue to receive most of the funding. This represents enormous opportunity for new public private partnership. GBennetti prides as one of the promising partners for supply of its life-saving and lifestyle products in NCDs to the world’s premium charitable institutions such as PAHO, UNICEF, and UNITAID to cater this epidemiological transition.
