            Our Quality Assurance is enabled function that only performs a catalytic role between research, manufacturing and supply of quality products worldwide but also as a facilitator that fosters and enforces a standardized total quality management system across the organization to ensure consistency, safety, effectiveness and efficiency in the manufacturing process.  QA is focused on:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Establishing quality standards (SOPs)
              </li>
              <li>Ensuring Quality by Design, validations, qualifications and calibration programs
              </li>
              <li>
                Developing processes and methods to achieve established standards
              </li>
              <li>
                Monitoring to ensure compliance through periodic internal audits
              </li>
              <li>
                Deviation and failure investigation
              </li>
              <li>
                Facilities preventive maintenance and environmental controls
              </li>
              <li>
                Upgrading technology standards and change controls
              </li>
              <li>Training personnel on quality aspects</li>
              <li>Packaging control, product complaints & recall citations</li>
              <li>Occupational health and safety measures of the facilities personnel</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Quality control Systems assure that the development; manufacture, release and distribution of drug products take place through well-defined and well-documented quality systems and procedures.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <span>Key elements for Quality System Controls include:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Facilities and Equipment System
              </li>
              <li>  Materials System
              </li>
              <li>
                Production System
              </li>
              <li>
                Packaging and Labeling System
              </li>
              <li>
              Laboratory Controls Systems</li>
              <li>Quality Systems</li>
              
            </ul>
            <br/>

            <span>This typically involves the following:</span>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Sampling and analysis of raw materials, packing materials, Intermediates and Finished Products</li>
            <li>Release of raw material and packing material for processing and packaging</li>

            <li>In process quality checks</li>

            <li>Microbiological testing of raw materials, finished products and water</li>

            <li></li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <P>
            While QA is committed to continuously upgrade skills and competence levels in QC function by introducing advanced technologies, theentire quality team is engaged in driving the quality philosophy of the organization assuring that the global standards of good manufacturing are implemented and adhered to in the best structure and moral fiber at every location during each process. 
            <br/>
