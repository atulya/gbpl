    <p>GBennetti also facilitates commercial manufacture of the developed products through technology transfer and rapid scale up at shortest feasible timeframe, ensuring that product hits the market for fastest return on investment.  The ultimate goal of the technology transfer is to establish consistent production that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Renders Robust and Repeatable outcomes in commercial manufacture
        </li>
        <li>
          Surpasses predefined quality standards
        </li>
        <li>
          Delivers on or within pre-defined time-lines
        </li>
        <li>
          Adheres to pre-defined costs and ensures cost savings
        </li>
        <li>
          Assure sustained or incremental revenue from the technology development
        </li>
      </ul>
    Our average timeframe for completion of Technology Transfer and scale up is three to six months.  </p>
